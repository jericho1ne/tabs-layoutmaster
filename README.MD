# Fuse mobile app demo (tabbed interface)
Modified version of this demo:  [https://www.fusetools.com/examples/tabs-layoutmaster/](tabs-layoutmaster)

## What to do
* Get the Fuse Studio desktop app from here: [http://www.fusetools.com/downloads](fusetools.com/downloads)
* Grab this repo via `git clone git@github.com:jericho1ne/tabs-layoutmaster.git`
* Run `fuse preview`

## If things break and you can't figure out why
Most brute force to reset your whole environment is to run the following (make it an aliased command):
```
fuse kill-all && uno clean && fuse preview
```
